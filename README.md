# Restaurant Management System Database ‚Äì Overview

This project is a **Restaurant Management System Database** design that covers essential operations such as reservations, orders, employees, and menu management. It ensures data integrity through structured relationships and constraints.

## Scope

The database supports core functionalities to manage restaurant operations efficiently, including:

- **Tables**: Information about dining tables.
- **Employees**: Staff details and roles.
- **Shifts**: Employee work schedules.
- **Reservations**: Customer reservation tracking.
- **Menu**: Menu items with pricing and availability.
- **Orders**: Customer order records.
- **Cash Register**: Keep record of bills.

### Out of Scope

- Financial reports(in-out)
- Supplier inventory management
- Customer loyalty programs

## Functional Requirements

- **Manage Tables**: Add, update, and remove tables.
- **Employee Management**: Add/update/remove employee details and assign shifts.
- **Handle Reservations**: Create, update, cancel, and confirm reservations.
- **Order Management**: Track customer orders and calculate totals.
- **Menu Management**: Add, update, and remove menu items.
- **Shift Scheduling**: Assign employees to shifts.
- **Real-Time Table Availability**: Check table availability.
- **Sales and Performance Tracking**: Generate sales and employee reports.

## üßπ Elimination of Generalizations

Regarding the **Employee** entity, it was decided to merge the child entities since the access patterns for shift-related relationships are distinct.  
This choice results in a more complex SQL structure but offers greater robustness in managing access control and the information/actions available to users.

## üßÆ Redundancy Analysis

**TotalAmount** and **OrderAmount** are attributes that can be derived from other entities:  
- `OrderAmount` can be computed as the sum of `(quantity √ó price)` for each item in an order.  
- `TotalAmount` can be calculated as the sum of all `OrderAmount` values indexed by table.

It is estimated that an order can be placed **200 times per day**, and each order may contain around **20 products**.  
In the worst-case scenario (20 distinct products per order), with an average of **3 orders per table (reservation)**, there would be up to **60 products** per table.  
To compute the `TotalAmount`, each product must be multiplied by its unit price and the results summed.

Therefore, **keeping the `OrderAmount` attribute** simplifies the calculation of `TotalAmount`, as only a simple sum is required.  
On the other hand, **storing `TotalAmount` becomes unnecessary**, since its calculation has already been simplified via `OrderAmount`.

### ‚úÖ Summary

We **keep the `OrderAmount` attribute**, even at the cost of violating **Third Normal Form (3NF)**,  
and **eliminate the `TotalAmount` attribute**, which will instead be calculated dynamically at the moment of receipt printing.

## Optimizations

### Indexes

- `check_table_number`: Speeds up table availability checks.
- `check_reservation_datetime`: Optimizes reservation searches.
- `filter_employee_role`: Improves role-based filtering.
- `check_shift_date & check_order_date`: Enhances scheduling and sales reports.

### Views

- **AvailableTables**: Provides real-time table availability.
- **DailySales**: Summarizes daily revenue.
- **EmployeeShift**: Provides employees assignments

## Limitations

- Assumes linear relationships (scalability concerns for large datasets).
- No flexible seating arrangements.
- No support for custom menu modifications.
- Employees cannot hold multiple roles in the same shift.
