## Optimizations

### Indexes

- `check_table_number`: Speeds up table availability checks.
- `check_reservation_datetime`: Optimizes reservation searches.
- `filter_employee_role`: Improves role-based filtering.
- `check_shift_date & check_order_date`: Enhances scheduling and sales reports.

### Views

- **AvailableTables**: Provides real-time table availability.
- **DailySales**: Summarizes daily revenue.
- **EmployeeShift**: Provides employees assignments

## Limitations

- Assumes linear relationships (scalability concerns for large datasets).
- No flexible seating arrangements.
- No support for custom menu modifications.
- Employees cannot hold multiple roles in the same shift.
